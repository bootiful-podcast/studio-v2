== Mission Statement

This module serves as the admin console, in which a podcaster can publish new episodes and finesse those that have already been published.

== A Big Rewrite

The new architecture is spelled out by examining all the projects on github.com/bootiful-podcast that are suffixd with `-v2`:

* `desktop-v2` - a Vue.js powered Studio environment for uploading and editing episodes
* `processor-v2` - a Python-based podcast audio production
* `api-v2` - an API to which the Studio environment connects
* `deployment` - this contains infrastructure that is common to the system, including RabbitMQ and PostgreSQL
